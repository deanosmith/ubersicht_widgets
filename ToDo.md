# To Do

## Sky Clock
- Add speckles for stars
- Add sunrise and sunset lines
- Correct sunset light overreach
- Assign night time as no colour (clockface)


"Currently my sky clock is attempting to receive the sunrise and set times from the API but this is failing and causing it to fall back to the 6 and 18 times.

Please thoroughly and carefully assess what is going wrong and ensure the values are taken from the API!

Note: The sunny folder and sunny.coffee script is successfully pulling these values from the API."
